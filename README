For full WebDAV support in NGINX you need to turn on standard NGINX 
WebDAV module (providing partial WebDAV implementation) as well as 
this module for missing methods

./configure --with-http_dav_module --add-module=<path-to-this-module>



Requirements:

	libexpat-dev


Example config:

	location / {

		dav_methods PUT DELETE MKCOL COPY MOVE;
		dav_ext_methods PROPFIND OPTIONS;

		root /var/root/;
	}


Important note:

People often use WebDAV with digest authentication, and there is a
Nginx third party module nginx-http-auth-digest.

Don't use original version from
https://github.com/samizdatco/nginx-http-auth-digest/, it has a bug
which prevents uploading files with whitespaces in their names.

Use well-maintained fork from
https://github.com/chazmcgarvey/nginx-http-auth-digest instead.
